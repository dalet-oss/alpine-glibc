## alpine-glibc-packager

Stores (in Git LFS), and builds when necessary, Alpine glibc packages.

Derived from a combination of:

-  https://github.com/sgerrand/alpine-pkg-glibc
-  https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-glibc-builder
-  https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-alpine-abuild


## Why is the directory tree the way it is?

... to fill in, explaining why only amd64 support...

##  Maintainers: adding a new glibc version

- Edit [glibc-versions.yml](glibc-versions.yml) to add an entry for the new glibc version, with dummy checksum.
- Push this change to `master`.
- Github Actions will launch the `compile-glibc` workflow to compile the new glibc version, and raise a PR including it and its updated checksum.
- When this completes, you should review the autogenerated PR, and merge it if appropriate.
- Github Actions will then launch both of:
  - the `compile-glibc` workflow again (validating the checksum); and
  - the `package-apks` workflow to package glibc into appropriate, signed APKs, and raise another PR including these.
- When this completes, you should review the second autogenerated PR, and merge it if appropriate.
- 💃 🪩 🕺
